# Graph_path_calculate
Calculate number of paths given length(number of edges)  of the adjaceny matrix 

#input is an adjacent matrix
#with calc_lenght you get a matrix with number of paths of a particular given length the co-ord of matrix
#the start and end node
#with calc_path you can query the specific number of path between start node m and end node n



# a   =  
##       [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
## [1,]    0    1    0    1    1
##  [2,]    1    0    0    1    1
##  [3,]    0    0    0    1    1
##  [4,]    1    1    1    0    0
##  [5,]    1    1    1    0    0
