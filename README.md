# Graph_path_calculate( python package)



Calculate number of paths given length(number of edges)  of the adjaceny matrix 

#input is an adjacent matrix
#with calc_lenght you get a matrix with number of paths of a particular given length the co-ord of matrix
#the start and end node
#with calc_path you can query the specific number of path between start node m and end node n



# a   =  
#    
#   0    1    0    1    1
#   1    0    0    1    1
#   0    0    0    1    1
#   1    1    1    0    0
#   1    1    1    0    0
